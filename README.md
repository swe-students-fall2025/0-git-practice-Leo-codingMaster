# Leo's SWE HW1
## Interest Article on SWE: 
[Some thoughts on LLMs and Software Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html) -- Martin Fowler
## Why Interesting: 
I found this article interesting because the author has some thoughts on "how people are really using LLM in programing". It is not just a fancy autocomplete, but letting the tools read and edit code. He also mentions that many surveys on AI's impact may be misleading if people cannot distinguish betwee simple autocomplete usage and more advanced workflows.

##Vaish's thoughts 
*From my perspective, I agree that LLMs go far beyond autocomplete into deeper code collaboration, but it makes me wonder how we’ll measure their true impact if surveys keep blurring the difference.*
